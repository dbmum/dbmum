My name is **David Mumford**.

As a software engineer I am always looking to challenge myself and learn skills that help me make my ideas into reality. Ever since starting to learn programming I have gone into every project with the motto **"It is possible, a computer CAN do that."** I havent been proven wrong yet. I am constantly surprised by the things I can accomplish through my programs. 

I find the most joy in computer science when I find a topic that interests me and I figure out how to do that thing. I have learned many useful techniques this way. My main skillset is in python, but I am familiar with many other languages as well. My current focus of interest is machine learning. I have been spending months on my own learning about nueral networks and how to use them in different ways in order to make computational guesses.
